# Project-Hex-Sandbox
A Python-based experimental sandbox for tilemap research supporting hex, isometric, and orthogonal grids. Focuses on evaluating tile efficiency for representing basic shapes (lines, circles, angles) and testing computer vision workflows (e.g., OpenCV) to convert 2D top-down map images into usable game tilemaps.
